# PyBer_Analysis
This change was extreme challenging with syntax error and missing parentheses. I believe an anlaysis of the "Schhol_Budget" breakdown by schools would have been worthwhile. I saw in the Module assisgnment it had 'School_Budget' but inside the jupyter file it request avg for reading/math score instead.
